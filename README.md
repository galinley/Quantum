# quantum
Math and physics are two of my biggest passions, and quantum computing is a super interesting intersection of the two.  Over the past couple of years, I've done quite a bit of R&D in the quantum computing space (both for work and for pleasure) so I decided to create a repository of some of the fun stuff I've worked on.
